<h1>Murakami's Miscellany</h1>
<p> Murakami is a literary master. Though his books often feature similar motifs, he is capable of writing in disparate genres. His works can be devestating portraits of reality that leave you feeling pensive and morose, or surreal and brilliant works of fiction that leave you hungry for more- if not a bit perplexted. Below is a list of his novels in the order of publication. Eventually, I would like to include ratings and reviews for these novels. </p>
