This webpage is my final project for INFX 598. I worked by myself on this project. I decided to make a page for my favorite author, Haruki Murakami. Originally, I wanted to create a homepage and several internal webpages, but I spent way more time trying to get the aesthetics right for the homepage, and I ran out of time. I also spent WAY too long learning how to use photoshop so I could splice together some photos to make a banner image, and then I realized the banner image was too "busy" for the page, so I just went with a grey footer instead. I put in some filler pages for the links, and hopefully I will be able to flesh those out soon. I am very happy with the site right now. My only gripe is that when it is rendered on a mobile browser, the cards are slightly off center, and everything I tried to get them centered did not work, which drove me crazy.
